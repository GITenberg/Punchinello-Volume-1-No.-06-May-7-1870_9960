      <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE DELIGHTS OF DOUGHERTY.</span><br>
      <br>
      <p>At the Banquet of the Army of the Potomac in Philadelphia, Mr.
DANIEL
DOUGHERTY made one of the most extraordinary speeches on record, if we
except certain forensic efforts of Mr. PUNCHINELLO delivered during the
earlier stages of his career from his box. Mr. DOUGHERTY is a Soarer,
and a Spreader, and a Screamer. Speaking metaphorically, be goes
higher,
measures more from the tip of one wing to the other, and is more
suggestive of the warbling of a locomotive in his speech than any other
Eagle in Philadelphia, which is saying a great deal. DANIEL is a Giant
of Rhetoric, and would remind us of the Big Gentleman from Cardiff,
only
that mysterious personage is too heavy to Soar; for which reason he
usually occupies the ground floor, which Mr. DOUGHERTY does not do by
any manner of means.</p>
      <p>It was this extraordinary capacity of Mr. DOUGHERTY for
Soaring which
caused him to be called upon by the Army of the Potomac for a speech.
The great D. begins by declaring that he would rather speak for his
country than for Pennsylvania, which, considering that he also declared
that he came "as a modest spectator," does not strike us as the depth
of
humility. However, "my bosom," said Mr. D., "is not confined to any
locality;" and we believe that Mr. PECKSNIFF said something like this
of
his own frontal linen. Yet, we should like to know what Mr. DOUGHERTY
does for a chest when his own has gone upon its extensive journeys;
something temporary is done, we suppose, with a pad. But the Bosom was
at the Banquet, and the proprietor was there to thump it, until it must
have sounded and reverberated; and if Mr. DOUGHERTY had also thumped
his
head, there would have been equal evidence of hollowness within. "May
my
tongue never prove a traitor!" cried the orator. Mr. PUNCHINELLO
hastens
to reassure him. The tongue is well enough, and is likely to be. It's
something a little higher up that is likely to give out.</p>
      <p>If the applause of the brave men before him was what Mr.
DOUGHERTY
wanted, (besides his dinner,) then of applause he got the Stomach under
his Bosom full. The speech was received, according to the reporters,
with a roaring which has not been equalled since the Lions in the Den
roared at the other DANIEL, until they found that the good man was
neither to be roared or sneezed at with impunity. The cheering was
"tremendous." The cheering was "terrific." The cheering was
"prolonged."
And there stood "the Bosom not confined to any locality," but just then
swelling, and expanding, and dilating&mdash;shall we for once be fine, and
say like an Ocean Billow? Voices which shouted at Gettysburg now hailed
Mr. DANIEL DOUGHERTY as a Conquering Hero&mdash;the conqueror of their cars!
Once in a while there was "great laughter" when Mr. D.D. hadn't said
any
thing specially funny&mdash;that is, if Mr. PUNCHINELLO is a judge of fun;
and if he isn't, who in all the world is? There are two kinds of
laughter&mdash;the laughing at and the laughing with; and we have known
"tremendous" and even "vociferous" applause to be very suspicious.</p>
      <p>It must be a source of calm satisfaction to General GRANT to
know that
he is considered the "great and glorious GRANT" by Mr. DANIEL
DOUGHERTY;
although DANIEL once considered Mr. BUCHANAN, poor man! to be equally
"great and glorious." So DANIEL also considers SHERMAN to be
"immortal,"
and SHERIDAN "unconquerable," and MEADE "glorious." Adjectives are
cheap, you know; and D.D., Esq., has evidently a great stock of them in
his Wandering Bosom. Only, great soldiers, who know the precise value
of
Mr. DOUGHERTY'S military opinions, might not care to have them laid on
too thickly.</p>
      <p>Mr. PUNCHINELLO has written to Mr. DOUGHERTY'S Family Doctor
to inquire
into the state of Mr. D's health after this tremendous effort, and he
sends us a bulletin that Mr. D. is "as well as could be expected." We
do
not know what he means by this; it seems to us to lack scientific
precision. The point upon which we wished to be informed was, whether
Mr. D. did or did not break any thing&mdash;not the tumblers on the table,
for that we should expect; but any thing in the way of blood-vessels.
Not to put too fine a point upon it, How's the Bosom?</p>
      <br>
      <hr style="width: 45%;"><br>
      <p><b>AMERICAN CUTLERY IN FRANCE.</b></p>
      <p>The great pride, the <i>dulce decus</i> of Americans, has
long been in their
pocket hardware, and the skill with which they use it. But we must
henceforth look to our laurels. France is competing alarmingly with us
in the use of the revolver. They were always a revolutionary people,
were the French, and revolving seems, therefore, to suit their temper
to
a T, (Gunpowder T, of course.) Since the slaying of NOIR by BONAPARTE,
the affectation of readiness with the pistol has become quite the thing
in Paris. New-York and Paris will soon be exactly alike in the bullet
business&mdash;especially Paris. PAUL DE CASSAGNAC, it seems, has been
invited by some anonymous person to meet him at a certain hour in front
of the <i>mairie</i> of the Seventeenth <i>arrondissement</i>, for
the purpose of
having his brains removed with a revolver. PAUL declined to go,
however.
The <i>Mairie</i> mentioned in the cartel was not the one for PAUL.
Probably
he would have gone to VIRGINIA, had he been invited to do so; but never
a MAIRIE for the faithful PAUL. And might have come by way of New-York,
where he would soon have grown so used to having his brains removed
with
a revolver that the process would have become a pleasure to him.</p>

      <p><b>PHILADELVINGS.</b></p>
      <p>PUNCHINELLO cannot help liking Philadelphia, and always feels
a pang of
sympathy whenever any thing happens to that plain old city. One reason
for this is, (and he is not ashamed of the weakness,) that Philadelphia
likes PUNCHINELLO and takes, weekly, he would not be vain enough to say
how many hundred copies of his journal. And now Philamaclink, as her
natives love to call her, is afflicted with a terrible disease&mdash;a
fearful attack of chronic Legislature. Even when the active symptoms of
this dread malady have subsided, the effects linger, and the consequent
suffering is excruciating. One of the direst of the effects of the last
attack is a dreadful bill&mdash;not a bile&mdash;which has caused a utilization
sewage company to appear upon her body corporate. It is almost
impossible for sister cities to understand the torments of such an
affliction. Nobody can now clear away their own dirt&mdash;Councils, Board
of
Health, or any body else. If rooms are swept, the sewage company must
take up the dust; if a pig-pen or a stable needs cleaning, the company
must do it; if the lady of a house throws the slops out of her
breakfast
cups, the company must carry them away; if a man knocks the ashes from
his cigar, he must save them for the company; if, anywhere in the city,
a foul word is spoken, the company must have the benefit of it. Even
the
birds in the squares must not cleanse their nests without a printed
permit from the company. If a bedstead is cleaned, the company must
have
the bugs. Only one dirty thing is safe from this all-powerful
corporation, and that is the legisiative delegation from the city. If
the refuse matter were taken from that, there would be nothing left. It
has been proposed that the Legislature itself should be purified; but
this idea is Utopian, PUNCHINELLO fears. If Niagara were squirted
through its halls, the water would be dirtied, but the halls would not
be cleansed. Alas, poor city! Trampled under the heels of the
aristocratic HONG and PENNY BUNN, what is there to hope for it?</p>
      <p>But all has not been told. There are about eight hundred
thousand
inhabitants in the place. Some twenty thousand of these owe small sums
for unpaid taxes, averaging about nine and a quarter cents to a man. To
collect these sums, an army of seventy-two thousand able-bodied men, at
salaries of one thousand dollars per annum, has been commissioned by
the
PENNY BUNN Legislature.</p>
      <p>Alas, poor city! But all has not been told. A private firm has
prevailed
upon the imbecile old farmers from the western and interior counties to
give them the right to build a private freight railroad through many of
the principal streets of the Quaker City. This road will run through
several school-house yards, and the time-tables are to be so arranged
that trains shall always be due at those points at recess time. Every
fiftieth private house along the lines is to have a road-station and
freight-depot in its front-parlor, and all male residents on said
routes
are to serve in turn, without pay, as brakesmen and switch-tenders. The
owners of all vehicles injured by the trains are to be heavily fined,
and the families of individuals allowing themselves to be killed are to
be mulcted in heavy damages.</p>
      <p>Alas, poor city! But all has not yet been told. A counterfeit
tax-bill
has been passed by the Legislature. All the sums handed in to the State
Treasury by the tax collectors have been found to be "bogus" money.
This
action has been indorsed by the Legislature, and the action of that
body
is hereafter to be of the same character as the funds paid in by its
creatures.</p>
      <p>Alas, poor city! But all has not yet been told. Colonel FORNEY
intends
resuming his "Occasional" letters in the <i>Press!</i></p>
      <p>Enough! Humanity can bear no more.</p>

      <p><b>THE PLAYS AND SHOWS.</b></p>
      <p><img src="images/05.jpg" align="left" alt="S">PECTACLES are proverbially fit for old eyes. Probably that is
the
reason why the spectacle of the <i>Twelve Temptations</i> is so dear
to the
aged eyes of the gray-haired old gentlemen who occupy the front seats
at
the Grand Opera House. It is certainly a brilliant spectacle, though,
like the ideal scene to which Mrs. NICKLEBY's eccentric and vegetarian
lover once referred, it consists principally of "gas and gaiters." Not
that it is exclusively an Old Folks' entertainment; for, as the critics
say of portentously dull juvenile books, "it will be found as
interesting to the young as to the old." Though the dullest of dramas,
it is so brightened by brilliant legs that it dazzles every beholder.
Why, then, should the stern advocate of the legitimate drama refuse to
acknowledge that the <i>Twelve Temptations</i> has its redeeming legs?
How
runs the ancient proverb, "Singed milk is better than it looks;" or
that
equally ancient philosophical maxim, "There is no use in crying over
spilt cats"? The stupid story of ULRIC'S folly is made more attractive
than one would suppose that it could be, and we need not weep over the
fact that it is a spectacle, and not a SHAKESPEAREAN tragedy.</p>
      <p>The bold explorers who have reached the remote Opera House,
fought their way past the misanthropic door-keeper, and gained their
seats, are first reduced to a state of mental chaos by the performance
of a maddening overture, and are then fitted to appreciate the play,
which proceeds after the following pattern:</p>
      <p><i>Act 1. Curtain rises upon a score of Unintelligible Demons</i>,
who sing
this impressive chorus:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! um um um um<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For um um um um<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And um um um um<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To um um um um." </p>
      <p><i>Exeunt Demons. Enter</i> RUDOLPH THE TEMPTER. <i>He
remarks to the
surrounding scenery</i>&mdash;"ULLERIC'S soul must be mine, or else the dark
abodes of torment await me. I will tempt him. Great Master, appear."</p>
      <p><i>The Great Master&mdash;a major-general of fiends&mdash;appears, and,
approving
of</i> RUDOLPH'S <i>virtuous resolve, they descend to&mdash;well, they
descend
below the Erie Building, to drink to his success. Scene changes to</i>
ULRIC'S <i>home. Enter</i> ULRIC <i>and family, including Aged
Mother, Virtuous
Heroine, Hated Rival, and Demoniac Servant.</i></p>
      <p>ULRIC. "Motherr, this slife is intollerrabble; I will do any
thing to
escape frrrom it."</p>
      <p><i>Enter</i> RUDOLPH <i>and Unintelligible Demons
(disguised.) They sing as
before.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! um um um um," etc.</p>
      <p>ULRIC. "The song says terruly. I will go with you, though you
were the
fiend himself."</p>
      <p><i>Consternation on the part of every one. Demoniac Servant
remarks, "Ha!
ha!"</i> ULRIC <i>and the Demons sink through the floor. Scene changes
to the
Studio of Eblis.</i></p>
      <p>RUDOLPH. "Take this collar. Behold these stripes painted upon
it.
Whatever you wish you shall have at the price of five years of your
life. A stripe will vanish each time your wish is gratified. (<i>Aside.</i>)
The stripes are only cloth, you know, and you can pull 'em off when
your
back is turned to the audience. Is it a bargain?"</p>
      <p>ULRIC. "It 'er is." (<i>Malignant crash from the orchestra.</i>)</p>
      <p>RUDOLPH. "ULLERIC, 'tis well. Now thou shall behold our
sports."</p>
      <p><i>Enter ballet girls, dressed in red gaiters and torches.
They dance the
Demon Cancan, waving their torches and scattering the flames. Old
Gentleman, in the front row hears such charming little asides as, "Drat
you,</i> MARY SMITH, <i>you've burnt my hand." "I'll slap your face,
Miss, if
you step on my foot again." "O</i> NELLY! <i>my hair's a-coming down."</i></p>
      <p>Curtain finally falls upon a blaze of light and a bewildering
wealth of
legs.</p>
      <p><i>Old Gentleman, in front row.</i> "Well, he! he! that's pretty
good; he! he!
Devilish pretty girls some of 'em; he! he!"</p>
      <p><i>Virtuous Matron.</i> "My dear, isn't it shameful. I never
saw any thing so
disgusting."</p>
      <p><i>Sceptical Husband.</i> "Then perhaps we'd better go at
once."</p>
      <p><i>Virtuous Matron.</i> "N&mdash;no. I'll sit through one more act,
and see if it
gets any worse."</p>
      <p><i>Fast Young Man.</i> "They're all padded, you know. You
can't feel sure
about one of 'em. There were gals in the <i>Crook</i> who used to pad
their's
from here to here"&mdash;(<i>adds explanatory pantomime.</i>)</p>
      <p><i>Travelled Man, who has been to Paris.</i> "These girls
can't dance, I
assure you. Now, at the Ch&acirc;telet they do these things
differently."</p>
      <p><i>Admiring Friend to Travelled Man.</i> "What spectacles did
you see at the
Ch&acirc;telet?"</p>
      <p><i>Travelled Man,</i> (who was in Paris only two days, and
never saw even the
outside of the theatre.) "It was&mdash;let me see&mdash;Oh! <i>Moses in Egypt</i>
was
the name of the piece. It was gorgeous; full of Egyptian scenery, and
Egyptian dancing girls and things."</p>
      <p><i>Admiring Friend, (with aggravating persistence.)</i> "Do
you mean
Rossini's <i>Moses</i>?"</p>
      <p><i>Travelled Man, (quite desperate.)</i> "Of course! He's the
rival of
OFFENBACH, you know. But come, let's go and take something."</p>
      <p>(<i>They go, the faith of the Admiring Friend in the Travelled
Man's
veracity being, however, perceptibly shaken.</i>)</p>
      <p>Three more acts follow. ULRIC makes a dozen wishes, all of
which are
gratified, and all of which have the inevitable effect of transporting
him into scenes pervaded by the female leg to an extent that easily
reconciles him to the successive loss of five years of his life. He
finally becomes King of Egypt, and, after having fought against the
Crusaders in defence of those well-known Mohammedan gods, ISIS and
OSIRIS, is carried down a trap by exulting demons. An Intolerable Comic
Man opens up hitherto unknown wastes of dreariness, and sings a comic
song that is positively more tedious than an article from the <i>Nation</i>.
The Demoniac Servant is continually shot up through spring traps, in
order to remark, "Ha! ha!" and to immediately disappear again. The Aged
Mother travels from Flanders to Egypt without changing her dress or
combing her back hair, for the vain purpose of begging "ULLERIC" to
repent. Consumptive Knights fight terrific broad-sword duels with a
thirst for combat that beer alone is subsequently able to allay. The
Virtuous HEROINE displays a very neat pair of ankles, but without
winning "ULLERIC" from the devil of his ways. Half a dozen ballets are
successively introduced, in which the skirts of the dancers are seen to
decrease as rapidly and steadily as the stripes on ULRIC'S magic
collar.
Finally, a grand Transformation Scene, which has nothing whatever to do
with the play, exhibits the best legs of the company in the most
favorable attitudes, and the green baize curtain falls upon the great
spectacle of the day.</p>
      <p><i>Virtuous Matron.</i> "Well, I never! It's positively
indecent. I'd like to
take a whip to those shameless hussies."</p>
      <p><i>Sceptical Husband.</i> "PAGE offered me a proscenium box
the other day.
Suppose we take it to-morrow night?"</p>
      <p><i>Virtuous Matron.</i> "I'll go to please you, my dear. And
really the
scenery is pretty."</p>
      <p><i>Wretched Man, who is shameless enough to admit that he
likes it.</i> "I
like it. The ballet's good, the scenery is splendid, and the music
might
be worse. Why don't these ladies, who come here and sit it through,
have
the honesty to admit that they come because they like it? But no; they
go away, and at the next party, where they wear dresses lower in the
neck than any I've seen on the stage to night, they'll abuse the poor
girls who have danced here for their amusement. Their malignant modesty
does not deserve the respect of an intelligent <i>figurante</i>. If
they are
sincere, why do they come here?"</p>
      <p>Which question still puzzles the perturbed mind of <i>MATADOR</i>.</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">GREAT BRITAIN.</p>
      <p>The Great PUNCHINELLO dinner has come off! JENKINS was there,
and was to
have telegraphed an account. But he was not so well as usual the next
day, the Thames water having got into his head. JENKINS never <i>could</i>
take much water. So your correspondent is obliged to trust to his
memory&mdash;unaffected by the water, which he did not take.</p>
      <p>Old London Tavern was the scene of this banquet, given by the <i>literati</i>
of England in honor of the long-wished-for coming of PUNCHINELLO. The
dining-hall was decorated for the occasion with appropriate portraits.
There were HOGARTH, CERVANTES, ADDISON, MOLI&Egrave;RE, SWIFT, STERNE,
GOLDSMITH, TOM HOOD, IRVING, THACKERAY, DICKENS, and ARTEMUS WARD. A
number of the waiters were costumed in character. From my seat, I
recognized SAM WELLER, (right behind me;) the Fat Boy of <i>Pickwick;</i>
SANCHO PANZA, and JEAMES YELLOWPLUSH.</p>
      <p>Mr. PUNCH was represented at the head of the table so well
that you
could know him at once from his weekly frontispiece. On one side of him
sat CHARLES DICKENS; on the other, your humble ambassador. It would be
rather invidious to name the other hundred guests; not to be there was
to be nowhere in literature. Near me there sat Lord LYTTON, TOM HUGHES,
PR&Eacute;VOST PARADOL, EDMOND ABOUT, CHARLES KINGSLEY, PAUL
F&Eacute;VAL, and the
Rev. JOHN CUMMING.</p>
      <p>Asking, in a whisper, of Mr. PUNCH how the latter very staid
individual
came to be there, I understood that, of all the absurd men of this
century, he was selected as the most representatively preposterous. The
PRINCE OF WALES was not asked, lest his morals might be hurt by
something that was said. And it is so important, you know, for the
British nation&mdash;(for the rest, see the <i>Saturday Review</i>.) And
then
Madame GEORGE SAND was to be there, who sometimes wears trowsers.</p>
      <p>MATTHEW ARNOLD was spoken to about it; but he replied gruffly,</p>
      <p>"PUNCHINELLO is Goliath of the Philistines!" and declined.</p>
      <p>JOHN STUART MILL was too busy over his next book, which is to
be "On the
Subjection of Horses." But every body else was there, so we did not
miss
these grave and reverend seigniors.</p>
      <p>How the twenty-five courses came on and went off, from the
ox-tail soup
and salmon to the dessert, it would need the tongue or pen of SOYER or
PIERRE BLOT to narrate; as it needed the capacity of a FALSTAFF to do
justice to them. And then, when the cover was removed, came the time of
trial to your correspondent. "The Queen" and "the President" were drunk
with all the honors. Then Mr. PUNCH called out, through his magnificent
old nose, so that you might have heard him across the Channel, "Health
and long life to PUNCHINELLO!"</p>
      <p>Now, your correspondent had remembered Mr. HAWTHORNE'S
experience at a
Lord Mayor's dinner, and had begged Mr. PUNCH by all means to let him
off without a speech. But, more worldly-wise than HAWTHORNE, he didn't
believe that Mr. PUNCH would keep his promise; so he had prepared a
speech, beginning, "Not anticipating any occasion to open my lips in
this illustrious company, you must allow me to speak altogether on the
impulse of the moment." (Hear, hear.) So this had to be delivered; but
for the rest of it, and of the dinner, you must wait for my next
telegram. Mr. PUNCH is going to have the speech published in pamphlet
form, for distribution among his numerous constituents. So, now for the

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">FISH SAUCE.</p>
      <p>The sight of a thick, four-pound steak, just cut from a
halibut that
must have weighed, (the idea of a fish wading!) some two hundred
pounds,
reminds us that trout-fishing is just now in full operation. What a
strange, weird mystery there is about mental associations! Long, long
ago, we possessed a favorite trout-rod fitted with a Hollow Butt, and
so
it is that whenever we see a Halibut, trouting comes to our mind.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, frogs were croaking, and insects all in green
livery, with
gilt buttons, contributed to Nature's Great Boston Jubilee of music
with
their hum. How ridiculous it seems that insects should have a hum!&mdash;and
yet the Bee has its Hum in its hive.</p>
      <p>It is at this season that enthusiastic anglers always get
water on the
brain. Their dreams are of gurgling brooks. They have visions of
mill-ponds, with beautiful little cascades sluicing into them over
dams.
They stand, in imagination, on bridges, in the eddies beneath which
they
discern the wagging of silvery tails and rosy fins; and a very common
form of nightmare with them is to fancy that the reel of the
fishing-rod
won't work, just as they are going to wind up a four-pound trout.</p>
      <p>Now, also, is the time when friend gives much advice to friend
on
the subject of the "gentle art." (A trout's opinion on this branch of
art, by the by, would be worth having. Perhaps he might not consider it
so gentle.)</p>
      <p>One student of the angle will say to another, "Always fish up
the
stream. Fish lie with their heads to the current and their tails in the
opposite direction: therefore, by casting up-stream, you run the less
chance of being seen by them."</p>
      <p>Another says, "Be sure you make your casts down-stream; your
bob-flies
like it better, as you can see by the way they dance on the ripples."</p>
      <p>Quoth another, "Always soak your casting-lines with water
before you
start for the river-side;" while a fourth instructs you never to
straighten your lines with water, but by passing them through a piece
of
India rubber doubled between the finger and thumb.</p>
      <p><i>Our</i> advice is, Never cast against the wind. In fact,
you can't do it;
and if you try it, you run the risk of getting <i>strabismus</i>&mdash;that
is,
the Cast in your eye. Artificial flies, like artificial flowers, never
should follow nature. Manufacturers of both articles perfectly
understand this; and hence the superiority of their productions to the
mere realities that flutter and bloom for their brief hour, and then
die. There is nothing in entomology so beautiful as a well-busked trout
or salmon fly. And then it is comparatively indestructible. Take a
natural May Fly and squeeze it in your hand. It is reduced to a pulp.
Try the same experiment with an artificial one, and its plumage remains
unruffled&mdash;which is more than you do, since the chance is that you will
have to employ a surgeon to extract the hook from the ball of your
thumb.</p>
      <p><img src="images/07.jpg" align="right" alt="[Illustration: &quot;SHOO! FLY.&quot;]"></p>
      <p>We are assured by a broker, who, in Spring-time, always
becomes a
brooker, that by far the surest lure for a large trout is the Greenback
Fly. He is acquainted with a man who, whenever he goes a-fishing,
always
has a four-pound trout to pack in ice and send up to a friend in the
city. By post, a letter is dispatched to the same quarter, containing a
warm description of the playing and landing of that noble fish. The
sender usually states that he captured it with the famous fly known to
anglers as the Green Drake. Facts are against him, though; and it is
well understood by his friends that the fish was first taken by some
poaching rascal with a scoop-net, and subsequently hooked by the angler
with a five-dollar Greenback Fly.</p>
      <p>Nothing in life is more beautiful than a five-dollar Greenback
Fly&mdash;except, of course, a ten-dollar one, or one of indefinitely larger
denomination.</p>
      <p>Provided with this most charming and effective of lures, the
angler is
always sure to fill his creel. He incurs no fatigue in doing so,
either, for all the boys of the village become his humble servants to
command; and if there be a four-pound trout in the miller's pond, he is
sure to hook it with the Greenback Fly, while the boys generally "hook
it" also, lest the miller should catch them at their tricks.</p>

      <p><b>HALL AND HAYES.</b></p>
      <p>The friends of Dr. HAYKS and those of Captain HALL are engaged
in a
heated discussion as to which of the two ought to be sent by Congress
in
search of the North Pole. As the public does not know who is right and
who is wrong, we present our readers with the arguments of each party;
so that they can decide which explorer is the man for the post&mdash;we
should say, pole.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT THE HAYES PARTY SAYS.</p>
      <p>1. The Pole being surrounded by water, must be reached by
boats. HAYES
is a sailor and HALL is not. Therefore HAYES is the man to sail to the
Pole.</p>
      <p>2. HAYES is a Bostonian; HALL is a Western man. Bostonians are
famed for
their skill in prying into every thing; while Western men stupidly mind
their own business. Therefore HAYES is naturally fitted to become an
explorer.</p>
      <p>3. HALL spent his time while in the Arctic Region in the
society of
Esquimaux. HAYES attended to his ship, and lived on pork and beef
like a Christian. Therefore HAYES is the better man.</p>
      <p>4. HAYES understands the use of instruments, and can take
observations
of the temperature of hot springs, if any are found. HALL knows nothing
about instruments, and could not tell the time by a barometer if his
life depended upon it. Therefore HAYES should be the Congressional
favorite.</p>
      <p>5. HALL is hot-tempered and once killed one of his crew. HAYES
is a cool
man and never killed any body, except as a medical practitioner. Cool
men are at home in the Arctic Region. Therefore send HAYES.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT THE HALL PARTY SAYS.</p>
      <p>1. If the Pole is surrounded by water, it must be a visible
point of
land. HALL is a landsman, and therefore the proper man to send in
search
of land. To send a sailor like HAYES in quest of land would be absurd.
Therefore HALL is the right man.</p>
      <p>2. HALL is a steady, hardworking, energetic Western man. HAYES
is a
meddling Yankee. Of course HALL is the better man for carrying out a
difficult enterprise.</p>
      <p>3. HALL has lived in the Arctic land as the Arctic people do;
while
HAYES knows nothing of the people of that region. Therefore HALL is by
far the best man to send.</p>
      <p>4. HAYES can have no use for his instruments in a place where
there is
nothing but ice. HAYES would, therefore, only add to the cost of the
expedition. HALL can take all necessary observations with his
eyes, which
cost Congress nothing and are easily carried. Therefore HALL is by all
odds the man for the expedition.</p>
      <p>5. If HALL is hot-tempered, so much the better. He will keep
warm with
less consumption of fuel. That he killed a mutineer is proof of his
resolute adherence to discipline. HAYES would never enforce discipline
if he dared to inflict no more punishment for mutiny than a draught of
Epsom salts. Therefore HALL is plainly the man to command an exploring
party.</p>
      <p>Here we have the arguments which both sides advance, and our
readers can
easily make up their minds. As for ourselves, the true course for
Congress to pursue seems so plainly evident that if we were asked which
is the best man, the Doctor or the Captain, we should unhesitatingly
answer in the negative.</p>

      <p>(Adapted from AUTHOR'S Classical Dictionary, p. 351.)</p>
      <p>"CINCINNATUS had retired to his patrimony, aloof from popular
tumults.
The successes of the Equi, (young Democracy,) however, rendered the
appointment of a Dictator necessary, and CINCINNATUS was chosen to that
high office. He laid aside his rural habiliments, assumed the ensigns
of
absolute power, levied a new army, marched all night to bring the
necessary succor to the Consul MINCIUS, (W. M. TWEED,) who was
surrounded by the enemy and blockaded in his camp, (Albany,) and before
morning surrounded the enemy's army, and reduced it to a condition
exactly similar to that in which the Romans had been placed. The
baffled
Equi were glad to submit to the victor's terms, and CINCINNATUS,
returning in, triumph to Rome, (New-York,) laid down his dictatorial
power after having held it only fourteen days, and returned to his

      <p><b>THE THIRTEENTH MAN IN THE OMNIBUS</b>.</p>
      <p>The New-York omnibus was constructed to seat and carry twelve
persons;
certainly not more. Indeed, when twelve men, of nominal size, sit
squarely on the seats and do not clownishly cross their legs, one may
ride in an omnibus with comfort. Nay, with these conditions, he <i>may</i>
generally escape having his toes crushed, his shins kicked, his shoes
soiled, or his trowsers daubed with mud by his neighbor. But alas! how
often is this paradisiacal state disturbed by the intrusion of "the
thirteenth man in the omnibus."</p>
      <p>Shall I attempt to portray the creature? He is pretty well
known, and
perhaps the picture will be recognized. Sometimes he may be seen
standing at the corner of the street lying in wait for the "bus." He is
never known to walk toward its starting-place, lest he might be
confounded with the "twelve" by getting inside before the seats are
filled. No; he is "nothing if not" odd. His very hat never sits
squarely
upon his head like the hat of a gentleman. It is either elevated in
front like a sophomore's, or depressed on one side, as if he had just
come from a cheap spree in the Bowery, or was troubled with some
obtrusive "bump" that kept his hat awry. If by chance he gets a seat
inside the omnibus, (as "accidents will happen," etc.,) he must cross
his legs and wipe the mud from his ill-shod feet upon your trowsers or
your wife's dress.</p>
      <p>Indeed, methinks it was he who invented sitting cross-legged
in a public
vehicle. Do savages ever sit thus when in close company? I have never
been able to imagine what special human sin this ingenious mode of
annoyance was meant to punish. It has been suggested that it might be
the man's pantomimic protest against sitting at all. But the saddest
commentary upon this vice of our hero is, that by some mysterious
magnetism of awkwardness and ill-breeding, he has betrayed into
imitation of it men whose early education has been less neglected than
his own.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, as he gets into the "'bus," he carries in his hand
or mouth
the stump of a half-burned, extinct cigar, which fills the atmosphere
with a rank and sickening odor. More frequently he is dressed in
well-worn black, and his clothes reek with noisome exhalations of stale
tobacco-smoke. Shall I finish his picture? I verily believe he is the
original Loafer.</p>
      <p>Methinks I see him in my mind's eye. I am riding in a Broadway
ominibus.
I have just handed up my fare, and, taking my seat, have surrendered
myself to a sweet half-hour of reverie. I disdain to spoil my eyes or
waste my time by newspaper-reading. I dream, and save my time for
better
things, as I conceive.</p>
      <p>The stage is full. "Twelve inside." The driver does not seem
to get
along. He is constantly stopping or turning his horses to the sidewalk,
right or left. You wonder what is the matter. You begin to think the
whole town is striving to get a ride down with you in that particular
"'bus." At every street-corner we linger or stop. Suddenly the door is
pulled open with a jerk and our enemy leaps in. He sees the seats are
filled, but he does not hesitate. There is always room for him. Indeed,
his "spirit rises with the occasion." He becomes pertinacious as he is
offensive. He tramples upon more than one pair of feet in his struggle
to reach the middle of the omnibus. The passengers patiently submit to
the intrusion with that quiet good nature with which Americans usually
suffer imposition invasive of good manners, or petty social rights.
They
seem to feel they can "stand it" if he can.</p>
      <p>His mode of paying his fare evolves a climax of unconscious
impertinence. In order to have free use of one hand to pass up his
money, he grasps cane or umbrella with the other hand, by which he
holds
the pendent strap. By this means he loses control of the lower end of
his stick, which thereby becomes an automatic instrument of torture,
menacing your face and eyes in quite a savage way. Indeed, his apparent
unconsciousness that he is a nuisance, and ought to be kicked out,
really approaches the sublime.</p>
      <p>He is a pet of the driver, of course. Some innocent people
wonder that
the drivers of omnibuses or cars should feel so very charitably
disposed
toward the human family in general, as to take up extra passengers when
all seats are filled. Short-sighted mortals! Do you not see it! The
more
passengers, beyond the complement of the "'bus," the more perquisites
for an ill-requited profession.</p>
      <p>To return to our black sheep. Look where he stands. As he
grows weary,
he grasps the straps on either side to steady him. His attitude is a
cunningly devised mode of tormenting his fellow-passengers. Either
elbow
of our nondescript just reaches the hat of your opposite neighbor or
yourself. With each jolt of the stage, by a little dexterity of
movement, or want of it, he can knock the hats over the eyes of two
persons at a time, and by a little shifting of his position he can
frequently bring down four by a single spasmodic lunge. When he is
fresher, as in the morning, and can hold his own weight, he falls in
his
more natural posture. Would you know what that may be? Did you ever
observe one of the descendants of the Lost Tribes who inhabit Chatham
street dreamily waiting for a passing rustic? He is apparently in a
comatose state. His abdomen is drawn in; his body is bent like a
section
of a hoop; his eyes are cast down; while both his hands are thrust
deeply into his trowser's pockets.</p>
      <p>But I grow weary of the subject, and stop by commending the
Thirteenth
Man in the Omnibus to curiosity-hunters as a fungus growth of humanity
nursed by over-virtuous forbearance.</p>

in the cold, let him go to Chili; or else up in a balloon; or let him
make himself Republican candidate for something in New York. We believe
the North Pole would rather be let alone. The whole subject is, at all
events, too HAYES-y just now to be comprehended. There is a sort of
KANE-ine madness, which shows itself not in fear of water but in an
insane disposition to do big things on ice. Haul off, Captain HALL!<br>

      <p><i>Impressions of an Outsider</i>.</p>
      <p>MR. PUNCHINELLO: According to your instructions, your
correspondent
proceeded to Washington, and there interviewed our present efficient
Secretary of the Navy, Admiral PORTER. I found him in his office,
surrounded by bills-of-sale of main-tops, carronades, iron-clads,
bo'sen's whistles, navy-yards, and other naval articles, the proceeds
of
which were needed for the future experiments of the Department. These
papers were being bound up into bundles and stowed away by his
assistant, ROBESON.</p>
      <p>After the ordinary greetings had passed between the admiral
and your
correspondent, the following conversation ensued:</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. Admiral, what do you think of the Fifteenth
Amendment?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. All right. When Americans want votes, I say, give
'em to 'em.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>, (<i>A little apprehensively.</i>) Votes are
different from boats, then,
admiral?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. Certainly. What do the negroes want with boats?</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. How are you satisfied, Mr. Secretary, with the
plan of always
providing you with a civilian as an assistant?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. I don't like it. Can't help it, though. This one,
however,
(<i>pointing his thumb over his shoulder at</i> ROBESON,) don't give me
much
trouble. Quiet man.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. What do you think of the condition of Cuba,</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. Very nice indeed! Got Admiral POOR out there,
cruising around.
Just like a picnic, you know.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. Are you in favor of the recognition of Cuban
Independence?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. No, sir! What's the good? POOR might have to come
home, then.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. You think, then, that recognition would not be a
Poor policy?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. Yes&mdash;no! No&mdash;yes! Doormat! You know what I mean.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>.(<i>quickly</i>.) Oh! yes. Certainly,sir! But what
is your opinion upon
the woman question?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. Don't care a snap. Let 'em vote. Won't make a
difference 'board
ship.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. You think, then that women will never be sailors,
Admiral?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. Nothing they could do. Except to trim the boats;
look out for the
mizen sheets or somethg o' that kind. Couldn't expect 'em, even in a
calm, to be brisk in manning the yards, much less martingales.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. What is your opinion, Admiral, of SHERIDAN'S work
among the
Piegans?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. (<i>laughing</i>). Neat job. How was that for Lo?</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. Good. Do you believe the Pope's infallible,
Admiral?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. The Pope's what?</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. Do you think that there is no such word as fail
with PIO Nono?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. No, no!</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. The Empress EUGENIE, Admiral, and Queen
VICTORIA&mdash;which do you
think is the prettiest of these women?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. Never saw 'em swimmin'. Can't say.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. What is your opinion about McFARLAND? Was he
justifiable, think
you?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. No! Poor shot.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. Have you seen <i>Frou Frou</i>, Admiral?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. Yes. In New-York.</p>
      <p>Cor. How did you like it, sir?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. Not much. Do for folks whose taste for that sort of
thing is DAILY
bred.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. What do you think of oar new City Charter?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. Is it a ship?</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. Yes, sir. It is a sort of hardship for New-York.</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. Well, the city must be used to that. Will take in
its ale pretty
much as usual, I reckon.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. What, sir, do you think of Chicago?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. Ah! go way.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. (<i>oblivious of hint</i>.) Where do you buy your
pantaloon stuff, Mr.
Secretary?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. (<i>sharply</i>.) Where the woodbine twineth.</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. Admiral, have you any children?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. (<i>loudly</i>.) ROBESON!</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. My dear sir, you surprise me! Is he your son?</p>
      <p><i>Ad</i>. (<i>to assistant</i>.) ROBESON! Did you see MIKE
HAINES?</p>
      <p><i>Cor</i>. One moment. Admiral! Let me ask of you, in which,
if any, of our
New-York companies is your life insured; and do you wear the patent
perforated buckskin?&mdash;</p>
      <p>Here the interview terminated. Your correspondent suddenly

that he would have barely time to catch the N. Y. Express, and he took

pursuing
him. He was used to being blackguarded by the enemies of his country,
but now he was hounded in the house of his friends. He had looked
through the whole Congressional Library and failed to find a precedent
for the course of the carping CARPENTER, except in the case of the
classic chap who had warmed a viper which had turned again and rent
him.
He did not mean to say that Mr. CARPENTER was a viper, but he thought
nobody but an Adder would put this and that together as Mr. CARPENTER
had done.</p>
      <p>Mr. CARPENTER said that the passion of his friend from Boston
for
maundering about himself amounted to a mild mania. All he had done was
to suggest that SUMNER had upheld States Rights twenty years ago, and
now pretended that he was never any such person.</p>
      <p>Mr. SUMNER said that twenty years ago the States Rights boot
was upon
the other leg. &AElig;NEAS SILVIUS had well observed that it made a
heap of
difference whose ox was gored, and HORACE had pointed out the
difference
between tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee. Unless his reading of the
Cyclopedia had failed to inform him, he believed that there was a game
known as "Heads I win, tails you lose." That was his little game. When
Massachusetts States Rights were invoked to aid the colored man, States
Rights were good. When Southern States Rights were invoked to crush the
colored man, States Rights were bad. As for him, give him liberty or
give him rats.</p>
      <p>Mr. HARLAN wished to know why the Pacific Railway grant should
be
passed. No officer of that railway had been to see him about it. He did
not believe in legislation of this kind. If a thing were worth having,
it was certainly worth asking for. He had no objection to breaking old
"ties," but he was averse to paying for new ones, unless he had some
personal reason for it. He wished he were altogether in the same
position as some of his colleagues, including these "bonds."</p>
      <p>WILSON, and CASSERLY, and THURMAN, and THAYER said that HARLAN
was of no
account, and that was the reason why he had not been "seen." As long as
a majority was prepared, it was wasting money to conciliate any body
else.</p>
      <p>Mr. DRAKE said he had a better thing than the Pacific Railway.
It was a
bill to provide that the Army and Navy of the United States might be
put
on a war-footing on the application of any three colored persons. This
did not seem to be profitable, but it was. The profit in it was a JOB,
but much subtler than in the Pacific Railway. He hoped Senators would
see the illimitable vistas of patronage opened by the bill.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">HOUSE.</p>
      <p>Mr. BUTLER insisted upon his bill to annex Dominica. Somebody
had said
that we had plenty of Dominicans already in the Southern States. This
was net so. He wanted to be Governor-General of Dominica. It was true
that silverware was not rife in that island, but there was an
infinitude
of potential voters, who could be converted into coin. The House
refused
to see it, however, and proceeded to discuss the case of SYPHER. Mr.
BROOKS said SYPHER was nothing. He did not see how SYPHER, who was a
nullity, could be figured out to be a member of Congress. Besides,
SYPHER lived in Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>Mr. KELLEY said that was the very reason why SYPHER should be
admitted.
Every body knew, who knew any thing of arithmetic, that a SYPHER in the
proper place amounted to a great deal. He would like to know what
objection there was to Pennsylvanians representing Louisiana? A
Pennsylvanian was sure to be right on the tariff, and a Louisianian was
sure to be wrong. Therefore a Pennsylvanian was a much better
representative than a Louisianian. Besides, SYPHER's hands were not red
with loyal blood, neither had he waded knee-deep in patriotic gore.</p>
      <p>Mr. BUTLER wanted to annex Dominica.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cox said he did not object to SYPHER'S coming in because
he was a
Pennsylvanian. He was an Ohio man, and represented a New-York district.
But be thought there were too many SYPHERS here now. An integer or two
would be more useful to maintain the integrity of the House.</p>
      <p>Mr. BUTLER said he would like to introduce a bill to annex
Dominica.</p>
      <p>Mr. FARNSWORTH said he didn't care any thing about the merits
of the
case. He knew the committee was all right. It was a martter of comity
to
go with the committee. If the House added a SYPHER, it would increase
their strength ten fold.</p>
      <p>Mr. STOKES said he would not weep for SYPHER if he were
rejected. But he
would sigh for SYPHER, if he could cipher SYPHER in.</p>
      <p>Mr. BUTLER moved a bill to annex Dominica.</p>
      <p>SYPHER tried to swear himself in, but he had been so much
irritated by
the previous proceedings that he found that he had sworn himself out.</p>
      <p>The House adjourned, except Mr. BUTLER, who was preparing a
bill to
annex Dominica.</p>

      <p><b>A REMONSTRANCE</b>.</p>
      <p>MR. PUNCHINELLO: In the <i>Express</i> of Saturday, April
17th, I read the
following announcement, printed at the foot of the regular weather
table, furnished for that journal by Professor THATCHER:</p>
"Prediction.&mdash;It will not rain within 3&frac34; days from 8 P.M.<br>
      <br>
"A. E. THATCHER."<br>
      <p>The positive character of this prediction made it very,
welcome. My wife
and myself had been invited by friends in Westchester County to go to
their house on Saturday evening, stay all night, and pass the following
day&mdash;Easter-Sunday&mdash;with them. We had nearly made up our minds to do
it.
They are very pleasant folks to visit, especially about Easter time;
for
the man of the house has a mania for hens, and, being a dyer by trade,
his poultry, using the refuse of the drugs instead of gravel to aid
their digestion, lay natural painted eggs of the most varied and
delicate tints. If I am strict in any matter of religion, it is with
regard to having a blow-out of eggs at Easter. My wife is as fond of
eggs as myself, (the yolk sits lightly, she says, which is a joke upon
yoke,) and she required no egging on to persuade her to accept the
invitation. We were doubtful about the weather, though; but the
"Professor's" prediction decided us, and we went.</p>
      <p>I thought it felt mighty like rain as we walked the short
distance from
the railway station to our host's. I had rain-pains in my back, and my
wife said her corns were shooting. Nor did our punctual aches deceive
us. Between that Saturday night and Easter-Sunday morning it began to
rain. Easter-Sunday was the wettest day I remember ever to have
experienced. There was no "let up" of the deluge throughout that day
and Easter-Monday. We&mdash;my wife and I&mdash;are suffering dreadfully from the
effects of Easter-eggs, which we were obliged to devour by the stack
merely to kill time, as we could not walk out. Should we die, I will
let
you know; but really it was too bad of "Professor" THATCHER.</p>
      <p>WEATHERBOUND. </p>
      <p>P.S.&mdash;Who is "Professor" THATCHER?</p>
      <br>
      <hr style="width: 45%;"> <br>
      <p><b>THE BIRD OF WISDOM IN IOWA</b>.</p>
      <p>Civilization, it seems, is making some headway in Iowa. Boys
are no
longer allowed to shoot small birds there, especially song-birds. And
so
the little warblers can pipe it all day, if they like, and when they
grow tired and hungry, they are welcome to refresh their small systems
at the strawberry beds. There is one feature of the regulation in
question, however, that does pain us. While vocal and fly-gobbling
talents are tenderly fostered, dignified Wisdom is not only neglected,
but persecuted. Our old friend the Owl is reputed by the people of Iowa
to be rather particular in his diet, (as all wise creatures are,) and
to
prefer a nice young spring chicken to almost any other "delicacy of the
season"&mdash;a proof of wisdom and refinement that proved too much for the
people of Iowa. And so they have left the poor old Owl out of the
protective enactment; and it is not only legal to shoot him, but
meritorious. The legislators could have stood the wisdom, perhaps by
itself; and possibly they might have respected the taste; but the
combination troubled them, and could not, of course, be tolerated.</p>

      <p><b>HOW A DISCIPLE OF FOX BECAME A LOVER OF BULL</b>.</p>
      <p>PHILADELPHIA, 4th Month, 13th, 1870.</p>
      <p>FRIEND PUNCHINELLO: I know thee treats our good city with more
consideration than thy brother journalists, and so it is that I address
the on this occasion. Last night I listened to the fiddle of OLE BULL.
I
had long known of this man, even from the time when I first attired
myself in a coat, (called by the world after the name of the abdomen of
a fish,) as one who</p>
      <span style="margin-left: 5.25em;">&mdash;"skinned a cat</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.75em;">And put the fur around his
hat."</span><br>
      <p>But having recently been made aware of the fact that this
fiddler only
availed himself, in his vain exhibitions, of a part of the <i>felis</i>
which
was not necessary to its felicity after death, I determined to give a
portion of my worldly goods toward the building of a light-house on the
Norway coast, for which purpose, I heard it averred, this man's
performances were given; and I went to the building where the fiddling
was to be, to see if it were done with fidelity for this end.</p>
      <p>As I sat in the upper seats of the house, serenely elevated
above the
vain throng, the man BULL appeared before me. His mien was humble and
his hair was of a gray tinge, which I attributed to the ceaseless
gratings of the instrument which he held on his arm, as carefully as if
it had been an immortal child.</p>
      <p>At first, though I labored conscientiously toward that end, I
could
discover nothing in the sounds he made which reminded me in the least
degree of a Norwegian light-house. But suddenly I forgot that useful
monument. Against my will, I seemed to be wafted aloft, even to where
the seats were cheaper; and anon, I felt as though I disported among
the
shameless figures on the ceiling of the house. I now forgot all things
earthly, even that suspicious bill which friend HOPKINS paid in to my
cashier on Second-day. Yea, my whole being became, as it were, strung
upon the entrails of a cat and tickled with the tail of horse. I felt
as
if I were wafted aloft on a blanket of shivering scrapes while
quivering
angels gently swung me among the stickery stars! And there I heard a
melody as though the edges of glass skies were softly rubbed together.
Then all was stiller, stiller, until methought I heard nothing but one
consumptive angel breathing in his sleep. But even that sound dribbled
away, until the last drop seemed to me about to be sucked down into a
hole at the bottom of the airy void, when suddenly there came a rush as
though a vast light-house of brass had fallen into a sea of tinkling
cymbals, and I jumped so violently that my spectacles slipped from off
my nose and fell among the vain ones below.</p>
      <p>A second time now came the fiddler forth, and soon methought I
stood
within a surgeon's operating hall. The player drew his bow as though it
were a knife, gliding over the limb of a subject in a sleep.</p>
      <p>So keen the blade, so soft the touch, the sleeper did not
wake! I
clutched my knees&mdash;my breath did cease!</p>
      <p>The skin divides!</p>
      <p>And still he sleeps.</p>
      <p>The muscles and the tendons fall apart!</p>
      <p>He moves not.</p>
      <p>Oh! That glittering blade</p>
      <p>It deeper goes!</p>
      <p>A&mdash;Ah!</p>
      <p>He wakes!</p>
      <p>He yells!</p>
      <p>Horror! And now, through flesh and bones that vengeful weapon
grinds!</p>
      <p>'Mid screams and oaths!</p>
      <p>Down falls the leg...</p>
      <p>I staggered forward. My hat, which much clamor in the rear had
not made
me remove, fell over the iron rail and plunged, resounding ike a sinful
drum, upon the head of a painted Jersey belle below.</p>
      <p>I heeded not, but groped me to the door.</p>
      <p>And now I write to thee, friend PUNCHINELLO. Can thee buy me
such a
fiddle in New-York? Thy friend,</p>
      <p>VENTER CLUPLE.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
